excerpt:      "This piece was part of a collection of projects for Multnomah University. They wanted a retail program, geared toward students, to market on campus and in their online store. The school wanted a piece that reflected Portland, appealed to the college student demographic, and incorporated a vintage, collegiate-looking crest. My solution was a hand-illustrated line drawing of a prominent building on campus with the Portland cityscape and mountains in the background."
