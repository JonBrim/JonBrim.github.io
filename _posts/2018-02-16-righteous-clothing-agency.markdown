excerpt:      "<h5>Objective:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Reflect ideals of established brand</li>
<li>Incorporate a clean, sophisticated, innovative appearance</li>
<li>Most be legible and scalable</li>
<li>Use red as the primary color</li>
</ul>
<h5>Outcome:</h5>
<p>My design expresses the connectivity of four shapes and their negative space that form the letter 'R', signifying the four pillars of production, online stores, fulfillment, and warehousing. The icon is identifiable when scaled up to an object as large as a billboard or shrunk down for a pen. The crimson red is a bold and modern departure from the original branding and it can be consistently applied by various manufacturers and vendors.</p>"
